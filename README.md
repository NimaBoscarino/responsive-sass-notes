## Fun Stuff

[Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)

[CSS Grid Garden](http://cssgridgarden.com/) - we didn't talk about CSS Grid, but you can take a look at this for some fun.

Welcome! Today we took a look at how we can write CSS that is _responsive_.

## Responsive Design

Here's an awesome article about this: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/

We also took a light look at flexbox: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/

For more about flexbox, I recommend taking a look at Garrett's notes: https://github.com/garrettgsb/w8d4-design-with-flexbox

Garrett's notes on responsive design + SASS are also pretty awesome: https://github.com/garrettgsb/w8d4-design-with-flexbox

They cover some things that we didn't touch on in class, but that you might find interesting.

## SASS

As far as SASS goes, the very best place to start is the main documentation: https://sass-lang.com/guide

It's honestly pretty much impossible for me to write a better writeup than what they have there. Take a look at the Github repo (linked way up above) to see the demo that we worked on to rewrite our CSS in SASS (for that flexboxy example).

## CSS Grid

We didn't talk about CSS grid today, but it is something that you might find worth looking at. It's one more way to do responsive layouts. There's a grid system in CSS, and there's also a grid system that Bootstrap (a CSS framework) provides.

## Etc...

Note about running this example:

- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- Go to `localhost:300/public/index.html`
- Edit the SCSS files, and see the CSS be remade.
